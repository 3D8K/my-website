# Webpack-assembly

## Description

This is my own version of CRA, it uses TypeScript, WebPack, Babel, SCSS.
I made it for the convenience of development, so that I don't have to configure the project every time.  It uses CSS and BIM, the application is adaptive, and also supports theme change.
##### It also contains a set of basic elements, such as:
- Header with burger menu
- Accordion
- Inputs/Form inputs
- Modal
- Theme swithcer
- Buttons 
- Loader

The src/assets/styles/wars path contains basic CSS variables that will help you quickly change the styles of basic elements.

### Technologies
